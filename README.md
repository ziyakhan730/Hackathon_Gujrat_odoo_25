We are making this project as a team to build **QuickCourt**, a full-stack web application that enables sports enthusiasts to easily book local sports facilities such as badminton courts, turf grounds, and tennis tables. Our goal is to create an interactive, dynamic platform that connects users, facility owners, and admins to provide a seamless booking experience and efficient facility management.

### Approach

As a team, we are dividing the project into frontend and backend responsibilities to ensure smooth development and clear separation of concerns.

**Backend:**
  The backend will manage data related to venues, courts, bookings, and users through secure RESTful APIs. It will handle authentication, booking availability checks, cancellations, and simulate payment processing. For email notifications, we will use **MailHog** during development to capture emails locally and **Hotmail SMTP** to send real emails during demos or production.

* **Frontend:**
  The frontend will be developed using modern frameworks (such as React) to deliver a responsive and user-friendly interface. It will include features like venue search with filters, detailed venue pages with photo galleries and reviews, booking flows with time slot selection, and user profile management. We will also implement data visualizations to show booking trends and earnings, enhancing user engagement.
